# Candidate Task

Write a Terraform script to deploy the provided sample React application to AWS <sup>*</sup>.  The application must be publicly accessible via http on port 80 using an IP address or a domain name specified at deployment time.

For simplicity, the React application to be deployed is the default application created with the following command:

```
npx create-react-app test-app
```

There are no additional dependencies.

Please submit your solution via publicly available git repo (such as GitHub), or via .zip file.  Please also be prepared to share your screen via Teams to discuss and review your solution with the group at our next meeting.

Solutions will be evaluated based on style, organization, implementation of best practices, and the ability of the candidate to discuss and review their solution with the team.

The output of the default `README.md` has some useful links and is included below for your reference.

<sup>*</sup> *We recognize that candidates may not have access to AWS accounts to test their solutions, and we will accept “best-effort” solutions that have not been tested.*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
